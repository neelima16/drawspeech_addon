ICASSP 2025 [[Paper]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10889767) [[arXiv]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04256)

## Status
This project is currently under active development. We are continuously updating and improving it, with more usage details and features to be released in the future.

# Getting started

## Download dataset and checkpoints 
1. Download the [LJSpeech](https://keithito.com/LJ-Speech-Dataset/) dataset and place the dataset into `data/dataset` with structure looks like below:
```plaintext
data/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1
 ┣ metadata.csv
 ┣ wavs
 ┃ ┣ LJ001-0001.wav
 ┃ ┣ LJ001-0002.wav 
 ┃ ┣ ...
 ┣ README
```
2. Download the alignments of the LJSpeech dataset [LJSpeech.zip](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DBRkALpPd6FL9gjHMmMEdHODmkgNIIK4). You have to unzip the files in `data/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1`
3. Download checkpoints from [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/HappyColor/DrawSpeech/tree/main).
4. Place the checkpoints into **data/checkpoints/**

## Preprocessing
```python
python preprocessing.py
```

## Training

Train the VAE (Optional)
```python
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python drawspeech/train/autoencoder.py -c drawspeech/config/vae_ljspeech_22k.yaml
```

If you don't want to train the VAE, you can just use the VAE checkpoint that we provide.
- set the variable `reload_from_ckpt` in `drawspeech_ljspeech_22k.yaml` to `data/checkpoints/vae.ckpt`

Train the DrawSpeech
```python
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python drawspeech/train/latent_diffusion.py -c drawspeech/config/drawspeech_ljspeech_22k.yaml
```


## Inference

If you have trained the model using `drawspeech_ljspeech_22k.yaml`, use the following syntax:
```shell
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python drawspeech/infer.py --config_yaml drawspeech/config/drawspeech_ljspeech_22k.yaml --list_inference tests/inference.json
```

If not, please specify the DrawSpeech checkpoint:
```shell
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python drawspeech/infer.py --config_yaml drawspeech/config/drawspeech_ljspeech_22k.yaml --list_inference tests/inference.json --reload_from_ckpt data/checkpoints/drawspeech.ckpt
```
